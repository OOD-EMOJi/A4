### Maze Contents

#### Tiles

Everything inside the Maze lives inside a `Tile`. 

Each `Tile` has a location {`int x`, `int y`} and optionally an inhabitant `Thing contents`.

`Tile` that are walls (`isWall`) cannot be inhabited.

#### Maze class

The `Maze` contains a reference `Tile[][] tiles` to each tile and their location.

It also knows which Tile is the maze entrance `Tile start` and goal `Tile end`.

`Maze` contains a `MazeGenerator generator` which is responsible for creating the layout of the maze. **You must run `generateMaze(int width, int height)` on a new Maze before attempting to traverse it.** All Tiles are null before generateMaze is called.

#### MazeGenerator

There are [many different ways] to create a maze! The `MazeGenerator` interface allows for the use of different algorithms to draw a maze, producing different types of passages.

`Tile[][] generateMaze(int w, int h)`: Given the size of a Maze, determine which Tiles are walls and which are paths, then return the newly populated tiles.

#### Things

A `Thing` is anything that lives inside a `Tile` that is not a wall or path. Each `Thing` has a location {`int x`, `int y`} that matches the location of the `Tile` it inhabits, and a character to represent itself visually.

`public char draw()` returns the character representing the Thing.

`public void move()` updates the Thing's location, sets its previous Tile's `contents` to null, and inserts itself into its new Tile's `contents`. If a `Thing` is stationary, `move()` is blank.

### Movement

#### The Mouse üê≠

The Mouse's goal is to get to the end of the maze, no matter the cost. It is currently unknown if the end of the maze contains cheese. What we do know is that our Mouse will stop at nothing to solve any puzzle presented to it.

`public class Mouse implements Thing`, so `Mouse` knows where it is located and what character it looks like.

`Mouse` can travel the `Maze` in [any number of different ways]. It contains a `List<Tile> path` to travel, a `Pathfinder pathfinder` that is responsible for generating this path, and an `int i` that keeps track of where in the path it is.

#### Pathfinder

`public List<Tile> findPath()`: Find a path through the Maze belonging to the `Thing` owner of this Pathfinder, and return a list of Tiles representing each step of this path.


## Algorithms

### Maze Generation

#### Depth-first search

The `DepthFirstSearchMazeGenerator` uses a Stack and two boolean arrays to implement maze generation. The paths are created much like a mole in a nest. It digs tunnels until it reaches a point in the	maze it has already visited then backtracks until it can move randomly again.

*NOTE:* A modification to this algorithm had to be made to compensate for our differing maze structure.

The mazes on [the Wikipedia page for this algorithm] use a maze with each Tile having four walls to begin with and remove those when creating the maze. Because our Maze is made of walls and spaces, this was tricky to implement.

We expanded the dimensions of the maze so that instead of checking the tile next to it, it checks the tile 2 tiles away from it. This is because the 4 tiles surrounding the Tile are considered walls in the other structure. This leads to a resulting Tile[][] with dimensions:	(2 * w + 1) x (2 * h + 1)

#### Prim's algorithm

### Pathfinding

#### Depth-first search

#### Wall following

The `WallFollowerPathfinder` keeps a hand on the rightmost wall and follows wherever that wall goes. By keeping a hand (...paw? claw? What do mice have?) on the railing, the mouse is guaranteed not to get lost. They will eventually reach an exit if there is one. (Our maze always has an exit.)
